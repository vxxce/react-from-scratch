**Just refreshing my memory re: custom, manual setup and config for a react app.**  
_(e.g. not relying on create-react-app or similar)_  

### Things:
- Using Parcel instead of Webpack.
- Still using babel.
- I don't know what else yet. Maybe Redux, maybe just context. Maybe styled components. Tailwind? idk.
