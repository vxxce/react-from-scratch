# Notes:

- Parcel's cool! Basically no config. Dev server's built in, css/style  
  loading done by default, hot reloading automatically, fast, etc. Do like!  
 
- Decide what to do re: styling. Try taking design a bit more seriously  
  early on? Use Figma/Sketch? SASS? Styled Components? Tailwind? Use BEM  
  naming conventions? Be a bit more rigorous from the beginning about these  
  decisions and try not to let the style sheet become a garbage pile :) 

- Look into React Spring and React Motion for animations.

- Do I want to mix this project with Docker ed?

- Maybe try... not Express or Koa? Maybe something from Pythonland. Or, hell, Java? PHP?
